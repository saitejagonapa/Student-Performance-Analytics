# Student-Performance-Analytics
Analyses the performance of students based on their class attendance and marks in the exam. It also compares the performance of students with low attendance with ones which have higher attendance. Uses MySQL to link data to Jupyter notebook and uses Pandas library to analyse using graphs and gives inference at the end.
